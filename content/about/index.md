### About
Hello ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Diogo Lewis Mesquita. I live in Porto, Portugal.

Iâ€™m a senior software engineer at [Cegid](https://www.cegid.com/en/) working on cloud-oriented SDKs. 

On my spare time, I like to build applications in public and share what I learn on my [blog](../blog/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/iamdlm).
