# 2023 Year Goals
For every company I’ve worked in my career, there were yearly goals to work towards, but I’ve never really done the same with personal goals. Well, the last couple of years have gone by, and I felt I did not accomplish much on a personal level as there was no tracked record and/or measurable improvements on key aspects of life such as health, fitness, finances, or career.

**So this year, and for the first time ever, I really want to do things differently.**

## Web Applications
**The goal**: One web application per quarter.

I spent the last days of 2022 thinking about what I should focus on, [S.M.A.R.T.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) goals I could set, and ways to track and measure them. After a couple of days, I decided that for 2023, I would focus on building one big project per quarter and a couple of other secondary goals along the year.

From the long list of side projects living rent-free in my head, I picked the ones that family and friends asked me if they existed and shared [the list on the 2nd of January on Twitter](https://twitter.com/iamdlm/status/1609963231224766464).

The idea with all these projects is to expand my knowledge in the Microsoft .NET stack, architectures, design patterns, and so on.

## CI/CD
**The goal**: CI/CD with a VPS and GitHub Actions for each containerized web app.

Every web app will be hosted in Docker containers in a Linux VPS, with a fully functioning Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery pipeline.

I have no experience in DevOps, so a lot of work and learning are expected when setting up everything, but I'm hoping the difficulty and amount of work required to get every web app running will decrease significantly with each project.

## Personal page and blog
**The goal**: Active web page with at least 10 blog posts.

While developing the web applications, I'll try to share here and on [my Twitter](https://twitter.com/iamdlm) what I'm doing, trying, and learning.

Social media posts will be about occasionally interesting or fun facts, updates on progress and launches.

On the other hand, blog posts will be about sharing technical details about what I do along the way.

## Community
**The goal**: 2300 points on StackOverflow.

Every now and then, I'll try to answer questions on StackOverflow because it has been proved to me that when trying to help others, I always end up learning and improving myself.

These goals are challenging, but I am excited to tackle them head-on and learn new things along the way. I know that building these web applications will require hard work, dedication, and a willingness to overcome obstacles and setbacks. But I believe that the end result will be worth it, and that my efforts will make a positive impact on people's lives.

**Here's to a productive and fulfilling year ahead!**
