        <h1 id="2023-year-goals">2023 Year Goals</h1>
<p>For every company Iâ€™ve worked in my career, there were yearly goals to work towards, but Iâ€™ve never really done the same with personal goals. Well, the last couple of years have gone by, and I felt I did not accomplish much on a personal level as there was no tracked record and/or measurable improvements on key aspects of life such as health, fitness, finances, or career.</p>
<p><strong>So this year, and for the first time ever, I really want to do things differently.</strong></p>
<h2 id="web-applications">Web Applications</h2>
<p><strong>The goal</strong>: One web application per quarter.</p>
<p>I spent the last days of 2022 thinking about what I should focus on, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria">S.M.A.R.T.</a> goals I could set, and ways to track and measure them. After a couple of days, I decided that for 2023, I would focus on building one big project per quarter and a couple of other secondary goals along the year.</p>
<p>From the long list of side projects living rent-free in my head, I picked the ones that family and friends asked me if they existed and shared <a href="https://twitter.com/iamdlm/status/1609963231224766464">the list on the 2nd of January on Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>The idea with all these projects is to expand my knowledge in the Microsoft .NET stack, architectures, design patterns, and so on.</p>
<h2 id="cicd">CI/CD</h2>
<p><strong>The goal</strong>: CI/CD with a VPS and GitHub Actions for each containerized web app.</p>
<p>Every web app will be hosted in Docker containers in a Linux VPS, with a fully functioning Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery pipeline.</p>
<p>I have no experience in DevOps, so a lot of work and learning are expected when setting up everything, but I&rsquo;m hoping the difficulty and amount of work required to get every web app running will decrease significantly with each project.</p>
<h2 id="personal-page-and-blog">Personal page and blog</h2>
<p><strong>The goal</strong>: Active web page with at least 10 blog posts.</p>
<p>While developing the web applications, I&rsquo;ll try to share here and on <a href="https://twitter.com/iamdlm">my Twitter</a> what I&rsquo;m doing, trying, and learning.</p>
<p>Social media posts will be about occasionally interesting or fun facts, updates on progress and launches.</p>
<p>On the other hand, blog posts will be about sharing technical details about what I do along the way.</p>
<h2 id="community">Community</h2>
<p><strong>The goal</strong>: 2300 points on StackOverflow.</p>
<p>Every now and then, I&rsquo;ll try to answer questions on StackOverflow because it has been proved to me that when trying to help others, I always end up learning and improving myself.</p>
<p>These goals are challenging, but I am excited to tackle them head-on and learn new things along the way. I know that building these web applications will require hard work, dedication, and a willingness to overcome obstacles and setbacks. But I believe that the end result will be worth it, and that my efforts will make a positive impact on people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s to a productive and fulfilling year ahead!</strong></p>
